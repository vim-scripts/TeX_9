    TeX_9 is a ftplugin that enhances significantly the writing experience of
    high quality documents with LaTeX and Vim. The scope of TeX_9 is to rely
    first and foremost on features that are already available in Vim and try
    to keep things as simple and snappy as possible. Indeed, TeX_9's codebase
    is only about 500 SLOC. 
    
    Most of TeX_9 is implemented in Python (2.6) and therefore a Vim
    installation with Python support is required (see|feature-list|).  In
    addition, TeX_9 depends on the matchit plugin (>= 1.13.2) by Benji Fisher.
    Matchit is shipped with the standard installation of Vim but it is also
    bundled with TeX_9 for convenience. See |matchit-install| for further
    information.

    TeX_9's main features are
        * Compile, debug and view documents from within Vim 
        * Insert LaTeX code snippets with ease
        * Select-objects for inline maths and math environments
        * Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references.
        * Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler)
        * LaTeX2e manual (ported to Vim by Mikolaj Machowski)
        * No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings

    Shoutouts
        * Carl Mueller, this ftplugin was inspired by his `auctex.vim' script
        * Vim-LaTeX people Srinath Avadhanula, Mikolaj Machowski and Benji Fisher
        * Johannes Tanzler

==============================================================================

1.  Installation                                    *tex_nine-installation*

    TeX_9 is distributed as a gzipped tarball. Unzip it to your local runtime
    path, usually `~/.vim/'. The scripts are located in the `ftplugin/TeX_9'
    directory and all TeX_9 files mentioned in this helpfile are relative to
    that. 

    Note! In your vimrc, it's mandatory to set `g:tex_flavor' to the compiler
    you wish to use or otherwise TeX_9 is not loaded at all. Other settings
    you may want to tweak are:

    g:tex_viewer  
        * Vim dictionary with entries 'app' and 'target'.
        * Default: {'app': 'xdg-open', 'target': 'pdf'}

    g:tex_bibfiles
        * Vim list that enumerates the BibTeX databases you want to use
        * You need only to specify the name of your database (don't omit
          the file extension) if the file resides under a valid texmf tree,
          that is under `$TEXMFHOME/bibtex/bib/'. Alternatively, you may 
          specify the whole path.
        * Default: None

    g:tex_verbose
        * Boolean
        * If set to 1, TeX_9 doesn't attempt to filter irrelevant
          error messages that LaTeX compilers produce.
        * Default: Error messages are filtered.

    Example vimrc for old school latex users: >

        let g:tex_flavor = 'latex'
        let g:tex_viewer = {'app': 'xdvi', 'target': 'dvi'}
<
    Another one for a XeLaTeX user that has multiple BibTeX databases: >

        let g:tex_flavor = 'xelatex'
        let g:tex_bibfiles = ['main.bib', '~/thesis/ad_hoc.bib']
<
    Before you start typesetting documents, you may want to customize the
    document template file `tex_skeleton.tex' in the `skeleton' directory.
    You can safely erase the header with dynamical content if you don't
    want it.

    Finally, should you want to disable TeX_9 temporarily, put this in
    your vimrc: >

        au BufReadPre *.tex let b:init_tex_nine = 1
<

2.  Basics                                          *tex_nine-basics*

2.1 LaTeX

    In an empty LaTeX manuscript, press <F1> to insert a skeleton of
    a document. Almost all other TeX_9 mappings are prefixed with
    |maplocalleader| that defaults to semi-colon, `;'. Typing `;a'
    would result in `\alpha' for instance. See |tex_nine-mappings|
    below for a complete listing. To insert the actual character that
    <LocalLeader> was set to, type <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>.

    The following mappings work in insert mode. Use <LocalLeader>C to
    insert a citation, i.e. `\cite{citekey}'. You're prompted with
    a popup list of citekeys if you set `g:tex_bibfiles'. You can
    keep on inserting citations inside the curly braces as long as
    you separate them with commas. References, `\ref{ref}', work in
    a similar way: the corresponding mapping is <LocalLeader>R. Label
    search is performed only in the current buffer.

    To insert an environment, press <LocalLeader>B. You're prompted
    for an environment name. Notice that you can use <Tab> to complete
    the names and arrow keys to browse history! Finally, should you
    forget the name of a standard LaTeX command, type <LocalLeader>K
    for dictionary completion, or should you need advice on LaTeX,
    consult the LaTeX2e manual with `:help latex'.

    You may compile the document in normal mode. <LocalLeader>k, `small
    compile', compiles your document once and doesn't bother about
    references; <LocalLeader>K, `big compile', calls additionally bibtex
    and should get the cross-references right. Typing <LocalLeader>V
    should open the document in your system's default PDF viewer,
    if you didn't set `g:tex_viewer' to something else. Finally,
    <LocalLeader>Q views the quickfix window where you get an overview
    of the potential errors in your LaTeX manuscript.

2.2 BibTeX

    Snippet completion is supported and the mapping is the same,
    <LocalLeader>B. In addition, <C-F> and <C-B> are remapped to jump
    between individual entries.


==============================================================================

3.  Mappings                                        *tex_nine-mappings*

    <LocalLeader> is semi-colon by default. Change the value of
    'maplocalleader' in `ftplugin/tex_nine.vim' to suit your taste.

3.3 Extras

    The usual inner paragraph, 'ip', text object is revamped to handle
    equations. Press 'vip' anywhere inside a maths environment to
    highlight its contents. The outer paragraph alternative, 'ap' includes
    the delimiting lines that contain `\\(begin|end)'. In addition, you
    may easily operate on in-line maths, e.g.  `$E=mc^{2}$', with the the
    text objects `i$' and `a$', inner and outer equation.
    
    TeX_9 completes dollar signs, parens, brackets and curly braces. In
    similar vein, type '^^' to insert '^{}', '__' to insert '_{}', '~~' to
    insert '\approx' and '==' to insert aligned equation sign '&='. 

==============================================================================

4.  Snippets                                        *tex_nine-snippets*

    The input prompt for environment completion is <Tab>-completable. Your
    input is matched againts words in `dictionaries/tex_dictionary.txt'. Once
    entered, the name of the environment is matched against keywords in the
    file `snippets/tex_snippets.snippets'. If there is a match, the snippet
    corresponding to that keyword is inserted into the current buffer.
    Otherwise TeX_9 inserts a generic environment in LaTeX manuscripts and
    raises an error in BibTeX files. >
            
        % Generic environment
        \begin{keyword}

        \end{keyword}
<
    You may extend the snippet file with your own environments and you will
    notice that the syntax bears resemblance with Michael Sander's snipMate
    plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540). TeX_9
    leaves the <Tab> key untouched so that you may still resort to snipMate if
    you so prefer. If your custom environments is not included in
    `tex_dictionary.txt', append it there. >
            
        :cd ~/.vim/ftplugin/TeX_9/dictionaries
        :!echo 'new_environment' >> tex_dictionary.txt
<
==============================================================================

5.      Tips and trick                              *tex_nine-tips*

5.1.1   Extending TeX_9: Custom template files

        You can create your own macros/mappings and enable them by placing
        them in a file that is located in the ftplugin directory and whose
        filename is prefixed with `tex', e.g. `~/.vim/ftplugin/tex_foobar.vim'. 

        You may, for example, create more template files for different
        documentclasses and insert them in your manuscripts with a mapping.

        Define the path to your custom template file in the file of your
        choice. >

                let b:mytemp = 'path/to/it/skeleton.tex'
<
        and map <F2> for instance to do the insertion in normal mode. >
                
                noremap <buffer> <F2> :call tex_nine#InsertTemplate(b:mytemp)<CR>

5.1.2   Extending TeX_9: Shortcuts for snippets

        Similarly, you may want to create shortcuts for snippet insertion if
        you don't want to use <LocalLeader>B all the time.

        An example for mapping <F1> to insert an equation snippet: >
                
                inoremap <buffer><expr> <F1> tex_nine#InsertEnvironment('equation')
<
        If you come up with something sweet, please drop me a line (email
        address in the header.).

5.2     Change BibTeX database on the fly
    
        After you've changed the argument(s) of the \bibliography command, you
        can update TeX_9's citekeys by first redefining `g:tex_bibfiles' >
                
                let g:tex_bibfiles += ['~/ad_hoc.bib']
<
        and then typing <LocalLeader>U in normal mode. The \bibliography
        command and `g:tex_bibfiles' will be kept separate to avoid problems
        when users view other users' LaTeX manuscripts.

5.3     Spell checking

        If you've enabled 'modeline', you may conveniently activate spell
        checking in your LaTeX manuscripts by editing the modeline in the
        template file.

        Example for anglophones: >

                % vim:tw=66 sw=2 ft=tex spell spelllang=en
<
        Notice that newer versions of Vim provide an option >

                let g:tex_comment_nospell= 1

<       for disabling spell checking of comments that otherwise get messed up
        pretty badly.

5.4     Remove temporary TeX files
    
        To delete the temporary files that LaTeX compilers produce, use
        shell/Vim expansions like so: >

                !rm %<.{aux,bbl,toc,log}
<
5.5     Folding

        With newer versions of Vim it's easy as >

                let g:tex_fold_enabled = 1
<
