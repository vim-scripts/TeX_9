    TeX_9 is a ftplugin that enhances significantly the writing experience of
    high quality documents with LaTeX and Vim. The scope of TeX_9 is to rely
    first and foremost on features that are already available in Vim and try
    to keep things as simple and snappy as possible. Indeed, TeX_9's codebase
    is only about 500 SLOC.
    
    Most of TeX_9 is implemented in Python (2.6) and therefore a Vim
    installation with Python support is required.  In addition, TeX_9 depends
    on the matchit plugin (>= 1.13.2) by Benji Fisher.  Matchit is shipped with
    the standard installation of Vim but it is also bundled with TeX_9 for
    convenience.

    TeX_9's main features are
        * Compile, debug and view documents from within Vim 
        * Insert LaTeX code snippets with ease
        * Select-objects for inline maths and math environments
        * Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references.
        * Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler)
        * LaTeX2e manual (ported to Vim by Mikolaj Machowski)
        * No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings

    Shoutouts
        * Carl Mueller, this ftplugin was inspired by his `auctex.vim' script
        * Vim-LaTeX people Srinath Avadhanula, Mikolaj Machowski and Benji Fisher
        * Johannes Tanzler

    Why create a new LaTeX ftplugin?
        * For fun of course! :-)
        * I wanted to have something more low-key than the venerable Vim-LaTeX and something more Vimish than  
          AucTeX.vim
